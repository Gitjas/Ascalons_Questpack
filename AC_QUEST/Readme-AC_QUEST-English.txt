***************************************************************************************************************

I. Description:

During the course of the game one is often inspired with smaller or bigger ideas for side-quests or stories that take place parallel to the story of the bhaalspawn. This modification is a collection of my ideas: Several quests or differing dimensions. Some are humorous, others of the tragic kind. There are puzzles and combat challenges. Several require a diplomatic touch. A few are race- and class-specific.
The mod adds quests to both BG1 and BGII. It can be installed dierectly to BG:EE, BGII:EE, EET, BGT, Tutu (w TotSC), and BGII.

***************************************************************************************************************

II. Installation:

- Backup your override directory, as well as the dialog.tlk, dialogf.tlk and chitin.key files, before running the setup.
- Extract the zip archive to your Baldur's Gate II directory.
- Execute setup-AC_QUEST.exe
- If this modification is installed as part of a BWP installation, it is recommended to do so during the section "BG1 QUEST MODS". 

***************************************************************************************************************

III. Notes 

- In order to be able to experience all features of the component "the lost son" gore must be enabled: Backup your baldur.ini and add the line "Memory Access=100" (without "") under [Game Options]. Gore can now be enabled ingame. Doing this is not required for the component to function, but it is recommended.

***************************************************************************************************************

IV. Compatibility:

Ascalon's Quest Pack was written in WeiDU and is likely compatible with all other WeiDU modifications. This mod was written specifically with the BWP by Leonardo Watson in mind and should work without issues for all BGT games.

From version 2.00 the mod is compatible with Tutu (w TotSC), BG:EE, BGII:EE, BGII, BGT, and EET.

***************************************************************************************************************

V. Contact:

If you experience any problems (during installation or ingame), then you can contact me via the email adress above or at the www.kerzenburg.nightisforum.de forums (my name is "Ascalon" either way).

***************************************************************************************************************

VI: Komponenten:

	Baldur's Gate I:

- A Job Well-Paid
What happens when adventurers are a bit too eager to spend their first big money? Travel to Beregost to find out.

- A Feast for the Gnolls
It was supposed to be a romantic picnic, but then everything went wrong. Look for Mrs Wellstone in Nashkel and help the poor woman find her son.

- The Great Carlini
Once a gnome's scientific curiousity has been stirred there is nothing that can stop him. Not even the spell that once cost the archmage Carlini hist life. Look for Ygnatius in the Friendly Arm Inn (he is hard to miss).

- Fangirls
True fangirls stay true to their idols, just like Cindy, Mandy and Ashley in the north-western part of Baldur's Gate...

- A Home for the Gibberlings
What does an artist create when out of ideas? Trouble, lots of trouble, considering what Gerlado the Splendiferous in the central part of Baldur's Gate has been up to recently.

- The Lost Son
All the half-elf Aphriel wanted was to lay down her bow in favour of a simple life. But then everything changed. Meet her in the bandit camp after dealing with the guards.

- Of Wolves and Men
Aiwell the mage has barred her doors - from the outside. Find out why near High Hedge.

- Flopsy
An epic tale of honour, friendship and bunny-rabbits.

- The Serpents of Abbathor
A mysterious dwarven kult is recruiting along the Sword Coast and heroes are in great demand! At the moment only te BG 1 part is complete. Loot Mulahey's corpse or travel to the south-west part of Baldur's Gate to get started.


	Baldur's Gate II:

- A Halfling among the Eyeless
Who will help Mrs Lawner to find her missing son?


	Throne of Bhaal:

t.b.a.

X: Final words

Since the first functional version of Breagar 13 months have passed (20 since starting my modding career). In this time I have learned a lot of tricks and techniques I would not have though possible when first I started out. Many ideas I had while playing Baldur's Gate are collected here and more are certain to follow. I am trying hard to learn area programming at the moment and will be sure to have something more to say about that in the future. 

And even though rewriting the same components over and over again can be grating at times, in the end this project is still a lot of fun. I know who I am doing this for: For you, fans and friends of Baldur's Gate! Have fun! And if you have comments, issues, ideas or maybe even a bit of praise, feel free to let me know. 


Good gaming! Buzzurk!
