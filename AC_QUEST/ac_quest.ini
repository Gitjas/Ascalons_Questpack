# File encoding: preferred UTF8 (no BOM) if unicode characters are present, it can be ANSI for English-only
# File format: ini as default and then HJSON/JSON5/JSONC/JSON (JSON doesn't allow comments) for advanced modders who want to use benefits of those file formats  
# File name: it must be the same as tp2 name: MyMod.tp2 => MyMod.ini (.hjson/.json5/.jsonc/.json)  
# File location: the same folder where .tp2 file is present  
# File content: every key=value pair is optional, key names are case insensitive

# Short description of the mod, main goals, features etc
Description = During the course of the game one is often inspired with smaller or bigger ideas for side-quests or stories that take place parallel to the story of the bhaalspawn. This modification is a collection of my ideas: Several quests or differing dimensions. Some are humorous, others of the tragic kind. There are puzzles and combat challenges. Several require a diplomatic touch. A few are race- and class-specific.
The mod adds quests to both BG1 and BGII. It can be installed dierectly to BG:EE, BGII:EE, EET, BGT, Tutu (w TotSC), and BGII.
