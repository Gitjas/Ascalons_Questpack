@119  = ~Lugosch and his men are dead and the Nashkel Mines are freed from their evil. What was the cult's plan regarding the mine? Are the dwarves who have joined the cult actually nothing more than outcasts looking for a new home? These are questions to which there is no answer because the track you followed ends here. Whatever the Serpents of Abbathor's goals, it is clear that your interference ended whatever they were planning for the Sword Coast, and probably set the cult's activities back for years, the least. All that remains for you to do now is talk to Emerson and report that the mines are again free - and to ensure that the Gundmagtor cannot be misused again.~

@10020 = ~The Serpents of Abbathor

I could stop the advance of the Serpents in the area of Baldur's Gate, at least I hope so. Lugosch Grayshirt is dead and I have no informations about any other leaders of the cult.~
