At an early age the elf Aphriel roamed the forests of Faerûn and became one of the greatest Rangers of our time. There was no scent she could not follow, and not one criminal was safe from her bow. It was only when she met a local merchant on a visit to the city of Baldur's Gate and fell passionately in love with him, that her days in the forest had come to an end. Their relationship was blessed with the young half-elf Perwell, and when he was kidnapped by bandits of the Sword Coast, Aphriel set out for one last time into the forests. During this trip the bow came into the hands of <CHARNAME>.

Now it's official. Bashrik Sparklehammer has traveled to the Sword Coast! That damned Do-Gooder will ruin us all. According to our information, he and this elf bitch travel from Baldur's Gate to the south... when he arrives at the crossroads to Lion's Way, we will give him a proper surprise!

The cult grew and soon migrated to larger cities, only to find itself kept down by the Shadow Thieves in Athkatla. Lugosch, who now had ascended to priesthood, was called away by the cult leaders to descend northwards and continue his work in Baldur's Gate.

The last entries of the book deal with his efforts to get in touch with Mulahey in the mines of Nashkel, describe the rude denial given by the Halforc to the dwarves and his malicious glee when <CHARNAME> freed the mine.

For them, Abbathor, the only evil god among the Morndinsamman, is considered the liberator and saint patron of the dwarfkind of the surface.

You cannot learn much more from the book because apparently, the notes of Bashrik were written primarily for the initiated. Only the last entry could offer a clue, should you want to look into the matter:

'I have departed from Wostok today. Mirjala and I will try our luck south, Wostok will take a look in the big city. We will meet again in the temple of Helm when I have more information.

Addendum: After racking the assassin who awaited us at the Friendly Arm Inn I have learned a name, at least. A certain Draglon appears in the Undercellars to regulate the affairs of the cult. Well, I will delay that until my return.'

In the headquarters of the Serpents I've learned some bad news: Their initial plan was, apparently, to capture an ancient dwarven device called Gundmagtor, which translated into common language means something like 'Caller of the black souls'. The main stroke of the cult seems to focus on Nashkel.~
@10012 = ~The Serpents of Abbathor in Nashkel - Lugosch

I was able to find Emerson's notes. He will certainly be pleased to get them back.~
@10019 = ~The Serpents of Abbathor in Nashkel - Missing Miners

I was able to rescue the missing miners from the clutches of a mad cleric. Emerson surely will be happy about the news.~
@10020 = ~The Serpents of Abbathor

I could stop the advance of the Serpents in the area of Baldur's Gate, at least I hope so. Lugosch Grayshirt is dead and I have no informations about any other leaders of the cult. But I cannot say why my own name was mentioned so explicitly. Maybe one day I'll find out this secret - whether I like the answer I do not know.~
@10021 = ~A Dead Dwarf and a Message

In Mulahey's cellars I found a dead dwarf who had a message for Mulahey - apparently the receiver was not particularly interested in what the messenger had to say. The message speaks of a meeting in Beregost. Maybe I should go investigate this matter.~
@10022 = ~A Mysterious Dwarf in Beregost

Tarash Blackhelmet was extremely suspicious and aggressive - I had to kill him. Among his possessions there was a letter pointing out that there will be an assassination north of the city...~
@10023 = ~A Mysterious Dwarf in Beregost

Tarash Blackhelmet spoke of the "Serpents of Abbathor" - whoever they might be. And he said that something is going to happen north of Beregost... I should keep an eye on the Crossroads.~

Aaron gave us the solution. Marina had promised not to go to sleep before she would get his engagement ring. I should bring her the ring.~
@10027 = ~A Ghost in the Cloudpeaks

It seems as if everything has been settled. Marina has received the ring and can finally rest in peace.~
@10028 = ~The Quest for Perwell

The elf Aphriel is looking for her son Perwell in the Cloakwood forest. The Bandits have kidnapped him and apparently took him to a secret location.~
@10029 = ~The Quest for Perwell

I've actually found Perwell in the mine and sent him out. On the one hand, I could certainly bring him through the woods... but on the other hand Aphriel could pay me a good ransom for the little one...~
@10030 = ~The Quest for Perwell

I've actually found Perwell in the mine and sent him out. I have no time to mess about with children.~ //"struggle klang so, als wolle der PC mit ihm kämpfen
@10031 = ~The Quest for Perwell

Aphriel is now searching for her son herself. At least I saved him from the mine.~
@10032 = ~The Quest for Perwell

Aphriel and her son are happily reunited.~
@10033 = ~Of Wolves and Men

The husband of the mage Aiwell seems to have been infected with Lycanthropy. I probably have two options to solve the problem: Either with a potion I can get from Thalantyr, or the old fashioned sword solution.~
@10034 = ~Of Wolves and Men

Thalantyr has enumerated several ways. He can mix the potion with Aiwell's blood, which is highly questionable. Or he can use Guril berries that do not always work. The best would be an elixir of belladonna. He also told us that he'll only be able to brew one of the potions.

I could also bring him the corpse of Thonder so that he can better understand the werewolf disease.~
@10035 = ~Of Wolves and Men

Thalantyr has dearly bought the dead body of Thonder in exchange of a Flaming Sword. Not bad either.~
@10036 = ~Of Wolves and Men

Aiwell and Thonder were overjoyed that the man was freed from his curse.~
@20001 = ~The Cult of the Unseeing Eye - Bunger Wiesner

The halfling lady Emmi Wiesner has downright begged us to look for her son, who was drawn into the clutches of the Cult.~ //"to look after" kenne ich als "sich kümmern um"
@20002 = ~The Cult of the Unseeing Eye - Bunger Wiesner

I've found Bunger and persuaded him to come with me. He will remain quiet until I have banished the danger posed by the Cult.~
@20003 = ~The Cult of the Unseeing Eye - Bunger Wiesner

I've found Bunger and persuaded him to flee. However, the cult has been alerted by that.~
@20004 = ~The Cult of the Unseeing Eye - Bunger Wiesner

I've found Bunger. He was, unfortunately, unapologetic and alerted the rest of the cult. I had to kill him.~
@20005 = ~The Cult of the Unseeing Eye - Bunger Wiesner

In an attempt to save himself, Bunger Wiesner died under the city.~
@20006 = ~The Cult of the Unseeing Eye - Bunger Wiesner

Bunger Wiesner has returned to his mother. The old lady surely will want to thank us.~
@20023 = ~A Mysterious Offer

A messenger has brought me an invitation from his master. Although he will keep his name secret, he somehow has an interest in me. If I want to get involved in a meeting than I'll meet the messenger in the Copper Coronet.~

Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

@80046 = ~These swords are usually referred to as doubled-edged swords, war swords, or military swords.  In many cases, the long sword has a single-edged blade. There is no single version of the long sword; the design and length vary from culture to culture, and may vary within the same culture depending on the era.  Among the most common characteristics of all long swords is their length, which ranges from 35 inches to 47 inches.  In the latter case, the blade is known to take up 40 inches of the total length.  Most long swords have a double-edged blade and a sharp point at the tip.  Despite the tip, the long sword is designed for slashing, not thrusting.

Usually their mothers or a talented aunt will create this sling for the halfling lad or lass who is about to embark on their second great adventure. The reason that the sling is given on the second adventure and not the first is that many halflings decide not to pursue the life of an adventurer after getting a taste of it.

@80053 = ~A dwarven smith, Silverblade, forged this hammer and two other items: a girdle of frost giant strength and a pair of gauntlets of ogre power. His intention was to gift them to his son, who was then a high officer in the dwarven armies, fighting the giant and ogre tribes of the area. Unfortunately, Silverblade's son died just after the completion of the three items and before they could be gifted to him. In grief, Silverblade himself donned the girdle and the gauntlets. Taking up the Hammer of Thunderbolts, he went to battle against the giant folk. He died valiantly.

Alone, the Hammer of Thunderbolts is a powerful magical weapon, but when merged with the gauntlets of ogre power and the girdle of frost giant strength, the hammer is transformed. This transformation requires magical assistance. The Hammer of Thunderbolts is then capable of doing an additional +8 damage as well as instantly killing any giant or ogre that it strikes.

@100032   = ~Aphriel's Elven Longbow

At an early age the elf Aphriel roamed the forests of Faerûn and became one of the greatest Rangers of our time. There was no scent she could not follow, and not one criminal was safe from her bow. It was only when she met a local merchant on a visit to the city of Baldur's Gate and fell passionately in love with him, that her days in the forest had come to an end. Their relationship was blessed with the young half-elf Perwell, and when he was kidnapped by bandits of the Sword Coast, Aphriel set out for one last time into the forests. During this trip the bow came into the hands of <CHARNAME>.

One of the byproducts of Geraldo's work with gibberlings was a high leather production. Since the painter only needed the fur for his colors, he sought a different use for the thick skin of the monsters... and found it. Unfortunately, the leather of gibberlings had some unexpected side effects and so Geraldo impatiently waited for a credulous soul to foist his experiment on.

The chroniclers are assuming that the great Geraldo laughs in his sleeve at the idea that some idiot would find this armor actually useful.

//Karlini Journals
@2000001   = ~The magnificent Karlini - The spellbook of the magnificent Karlini

Inside the Friendly Arm Inn we met a gnome called Ygnatius Bombastus III.
He offered 300 pieces of gold if we receive one of the spellbooks of the magnificent Karlini which could be found inside the Ulcaster Ruins.~

@2000002   = ~The magnificent Karlini - The spellbook of the magnificent Karlini

Luckily we found the spellbook of the magnificent Karlini in the Ulcaster Ruins.~

@2000003   = ~The magnificent Karlini - The spellbook of the magnificent Karlini

We gave Ygnatius the spellbook of the magnificent Karlini as promissed. After some research he found the fitting spell to track down Karlini and we agreed to oversee his task of casting the spell. For that we will meet with Ygnatius at the stone cirlce at Lion's Way.~

@2000004   = ~The magnificent Karlini

We told Ygnatius to not continue working for him.~

@2000005   = ~The magnificent Karlini

We gave Ygnatius the spellbook of the magnificent Karlini and received our reward as promissed.~

@2000006   = ~The magnificent Karlini

We oversaw the casting of the spell but surprisingly a balor appeared and Ygnatius vanished. It was a tough fight to take the balor down but we did it. Unfortunately we don't know of a way to bring Ygnatius back from whereever he is right now.~

@2000007   = ~The magnificent Karlini

We oversaw the casting of the spell but surprisingly a balor appeared and Ygnatius vanished. Unexpectedly the fiend agreed on letting the two gnomes go for my soul in exchange. I refused the offer and the balor vanished into thin air.~

@2000008   = ~The magnificent Karlini

We oversaw the casting of the spell but surprisingly a balor appeared and Ygnatius vanished. Unexpectedly the fiend agreed on letting the two gnomes go if we would answer some difficult questions about the Sword Coast correctly. Otherwise my soul would be his reward. By luck and effort I was able to answer all three questions correctly. In return the balor vanished into thin air but stayed true to his word and brought the two gnomes back save and sound. They in return were thankful - more or less- for their rescue. Gnomes ... In retrospect the delivered reward by theese two gnomes was fitting the needed efforts to solve the given tasks.~

//Geraldo's Journal entries

@3000001   = ~Breeding Gibberlings in Baldur's Gate

Travelling through the streets of Baldur's Gate we met a man who referred to himself as 'Geraldo the Magnificent'. He told us he had planned to create blue colour from the fur of gibberlings but when they started to breed uncontrollably he was forced to imprison them in his own house. He asked us to go to his house and deal with the monsters inside. By now there should be around 20 of the little beasts there.~
@3000002   = ~Breeding Gibberlings in Baldur's Gate

There were only two gibberlings in Geraldos house. We should return to him and give him the furs anyway.~
@3000003   = ~Breeding Gibberlings in Baldur's Gate

Geraldo asked us to find the remaining gibberlings. To make things easier he gave us a bird named Elminster, who will notify us when gibberlings are in the vicinity. To sweeten the deal he will also reward us with 50 pieces of gold for every fur collected, and a useful item should we be able to find all of them.~
@3000004   = ~Breeding Gibberlings in Baldur's Gate

We were able to find all the remaining gibberlings. When we informed Geraldo he inexplicably left, mumbling something about finding his luck somewhere else.~

We told Geraldo that we quit his little task. He mumbled something about finding his luck somewhere else and left.~

I agreed to confront this Draglon who was mentioned in Bashrik's journal. As far as I know he might be in the Undercellars.~

@3000009  = ~The Serpents of Abbathor

I confronted Draglon, but he escaped. I should return to the temple of Helm and talk to the dwarves.~

@3000010  = ~The Serpents of Abbathor

A mage named Jenna keeps an artifact for the dwarves. She and her companion Jassir reside in the Northwestern District's tavern. I need to go there and tell her "Greetings from Mirjala" for password.~

@3000011  = ~The Serpents of Abbathor

I decided to help the dwarves no further.~

@3000012  = ~The Serpents of Abbathor

Jenna was killed by the Serpent's minions, and the artefact was taken. I should return to Wostock and tell him about it!~

@3000013  = ~The Serpents of Abbathor

I agreed to have a look at a warehouse in the Southeastern District of Baldur's Gate. We believe this to be the hideout from the Serpents of Abbathor. I will need a key to enter.~
