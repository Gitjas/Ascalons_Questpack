# Ascalons_Questpack: The Serpents of Abbathor Part 1 and other stories

A modification for BG:EE, BGT-WeiDU, Tutu (w TotSC), BGII:EE, BGII, and EET
                            
Author: Ascalon
Current Maintainer: Gitjas

During the course of the game one is often inspired with smaller or bigger ideas for side-quests or stories that take place parallel to the story of the bhaalspawn. This modification is a collection of my ideas: Several quests or differing dimensions. Some are humorous, others of the tragic kind. There are puzzles and combat challenges. Several require a diplomatic touch. A few are race- and class-specific.
The mod adds quests to both BG1 and BGII. It can be installed dierectly to BG:EE, BGII:EE, EET, BGT, Tutu (w TotSC), and BGII.

For compatibility with Glam's NPC Pack, install the "Beregost" install choice for the component "From Wolves and Men".
Ascalon's Questpack should be installed before NPC mods, especially Ascalon's Breagar, Brage's Redemption, and Brandock the Mage.

## Komponenten:

### Baldur's Gate I:

### 1 A Job Well-Paid
-------------------------
What happens when adventurers are a bit too eager to spend their first big money? Travel to Beregost to find out.

### 2 A Feast for the Gnolls
-------------------------
It was supposed to be a romantic picnic, but then everything went wrong. Look for Mrs Wellstone in Nashkel and help the poor woman find her son.

### 3 Jumper
-------------------------
An epic tale of honour, friendship and bunny-rabbits.

### 4 The Lost Son
-------------------------
All the half-elf Aphriel wanted was to lay down her bow in favour of a simple life. But then everything changed. Meet her in the Cloakwood Lodge area.

### 5 Of Wolves and Men
-------------------------
Aiwell the mage has barred her doors - from the outside. Find out why near High Hedge.

This component has two options: the first uses the hut near Thalantyr's Abode in HighHedge.
The second option moves the home of the couple into a house in Beregost ("House 9" on Dudleyville's Walkthrough on the southwest boundary of Beregost). This is mainly for compatibility reasons because Glam's NPC Pack uses the hut in High Hedge for something else. Install this component if you want to play both mods together.

### 6 The Great Carlini
-------------------------
Once a gnome's scientific curiousity has been stirred there is nothing that can stop him. Not even the spell that once cost the archmage Carlini hist life. Look for Ygnatius in the Friendly Arm Inn (he is hard to miss).

### 7 A Home for the Gibberlings
-------------------------
What does an artist create when out of ideas? Trouble, lots of trouble, considering what Geraldo the Splendiferous in the central part of Baldur's Gate has been up to recently.

### 8 Fangirls
-------------------------
True fangirls stay true to their idols, just like Cindy, Mandy and Ashley in the north-western part of Baldur's Gate...

### 9 The Serpents of Abbathor
-------------------------
A mysterious dwarven kult is recruiting along the Sword Coast and heroes are in great demand! At the moment only te BG 1 part is complete. Loot Mulahey's corpse or travel to the south-west part of Baldur's Gate to get started.


### Baldur's Gate II:

### 10 A Halfling among the Eyeless
-------------------------
Who will help Mrs Lawner to find her missing son?
